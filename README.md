# DBManagement
A simple database management system that I am making to help me get a better understanding of CRUD applications.
I don't want this to be a cookie cutter project coppied off of Youtube,but rather I want to learn how to make these applications better.

##Project Roadmap:
 
 1) Create a template project to learn the basics of CRUD Operations  **<------**
 
 2) Make changes to the project to make it more personalized and useful for a real world project. In this case I would like to make it a Course Student management system.
 
 3) Add user authentication such that the teachers can view and edit the student records. And the students can only view their record.


##Tools being used currently:
 - NodeJS
 - Express
 - MongoDB
