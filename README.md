# DBManagement
A simple database management system that I am making to help me get a better understanding of CRUD applications.
I don't want this to be a cookie cutter project coppied off of Youtube,but rather I want to learn how to make these applications better.

## Project Roadmap:
 
 1) Create the initial project to learn the basics of CRUD Operations, and the project should have a basic database system.
 
 2) **Add user authentication such that the users can see their own records and changes instead of puplically accessing them.<----**

## Main Tools being used currently:
 - NodeJS
 - Express
 - MongoDB
 - EJS
