# [DBManagement](https://dbmanager-nodejs.herokuapp.com/) 

## Current demo not workin, because the heroku server is shut down (for certain tiers). I am working on hosting my app in a different server.

A simple database management system that I am making to help me get a better understanding of CRUD applications. It's made with MongoDB, Express, and Node JS. It uses the Passport login system for conducting user authentication, which uses JWT. 

## Project Roadmap:
 
 1) Create the initial project to learn the basics of CRUD Operations, and the project should have a basic database system.
 
 2) Add user authentication such that the users can see their own records and changes instead of puplically accessing them.
 
 3) Project deployed in Heruko. [View demo Here](https://dbmanager-nodejs.herokuapp.com/) 



## Main Tools being used currently:
 - NodeJS
 - Express
 - MongoDB
 - EJS
